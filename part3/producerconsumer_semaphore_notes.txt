What to do:

1. Implement consumer producer method using semaphores in both pthreads and uthreads.
    --> pc_sem_uthread.c --> start from provided file in uthreads.
    --> leave out wait counts out of implementations
    --> use semaphores to replace mutex and condition variables
    --> only permitted to use wait and signal for synchronization primitives


** use sem_wait() and sem_signal()
