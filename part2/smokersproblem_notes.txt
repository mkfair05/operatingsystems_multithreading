What to do:

1. Create solution using pthreads - smoke_pthreads.c
    -->create four threads
    -->iterate
        --> each iteration choose two resources randomly, signal condition variables, 
            wait on condition variable (signal) that smokers able to smoke
    --> agent has four condition variables
        --> one to wait for smokers, 3 for resources (1 each - paper, tobacco, matches)
        --> agent indicate resource available by calling resource's condition variable 




2. Create solution using uthreads
    --> code for agent provided for us

3. Testing
    --> use printf statements to know what each thread is doing
        --> use before and after every statement that could block (every wait?)
    --> put agrent through many iterations
        --> have agent count the expected times each smoker should smoke
        --> have each smoker count number of times that each smokes
            --> compare numbers to ensure they're equal
            --> print number when program terminates
